# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

Version 1.1

# Effective Date: 05/18/2023

## 1. Purpose:

   This SOP provides the proper course of action for the enhancement of network usabiity and security.

## 2. Responsibilities:

   Roles and responsibilities for executing this procedure as follows: Service Desk Analyst, Security Engineer, Network Administrator, Systems Administrator, IT Manager
   
## 3. Definitions and Abbrevations:

   MSP - Managed Service Provider
   
## 4. Procedure:

 ## Establish Secure Network Authentication Methods
  
  A. Implement two-factor authentication to secure user access to the network
  
  B. Restricted guest access to wireless networks
  
  C. Require strong passwords and password expiration settings
  
  D. Monitor user accounts for unusual activity
  
 ## Establish and Maintain Comprehensive Network Security Policies
 
  A. Maintain a comprehensive security policy to protect the network from various threats
  
  B. Regularly review and update the security policies for compliance
  
  C. Established user access and privilege levels for data access
  
  D. Policies for data encryption and storage
  
 ## Maintain Secure Configuration Standards
 
  A. Ensure regular patching and updates to operating systems to reduce security vulnerabilities
  
  B. Identify weak passwords and enforce strong password requirements
  
  C. Disable unused services to reduce risk of exploitation
  
  D. Establish access control lists to control user access to certain resources
  
  
## 5. Safety Considerations:

 ## Safety precautions that should be followed during the execution of this procedure include:

• Avoid providing administrative privileges to users until they have been authenticated and authorized.

• Ensure that security patching and regular updates are kept up to date to reduce potential security risks.

• Avoid connecting to systems without an antivirus in place, to protect against malicious threats.

• Utilize strong encryption practices for online communication.

• Restrict access to the system’s most sensitive resources and areas to known users only.

• Monitor the system for unusual or suspicious activity and respond quickly to any potential incidents.

• Establish clear policies and procedures for responding to security incidents and breaches.

## 6. Troubleshooting and Problem Solving:

  Common issues and challenges that may arise during the process of enhancing the usability and security of the network include:
  
  • Difficulty implementing two-factor authentication: To ensure two-factor authentication is implemented properly, users should be provided with instructions on how to activate the authentication mechanism and what steps need to be taken each time they log in.
  
  •Poorly configured passwords: Users should be trained on the importance of strong passwords and required to use passwords of sufficient length and complexity.
  
  • Weak configuration policies: A Security Engineer should be regularly consulted and allowed to assess the network environment and make recommendations for best practices and policies.
  
  • Lack of Security Monitoring Technologies: An experienced Security Engineer should be consulted to help identify and implement the appropriate measures and technologies.
